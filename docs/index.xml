      <description>Starlark Standard Library All qri transforms have access to &amp;ldquo;starlib&amp;rdquo;, a community-driven project to bring a standard library to the starlark programming dialect. Qri needs a standard library, and we thought it might benefit others to structure this library in a reusable way. starlib is admittedly biased towards Qri&amp;rsquo;s needs.

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dustin, and I work on Qri, helping build our tool for reusable, reproducible, reliable datasets on IPFS. My focus since joining earlier this year has been improving the stability and especially the performance of our application backend. A few months into working on this task, I was especially pained at how slow our entire unit test suite was taking to run - up to nearly 5 minutes on my machine.</description>

      <description>Is qri a blockchain? Nope.
What’s a dataset? Datasets are a data structure that is broken up in a way that allows us to link changes between parts of that data structure on a content addressed file system, preserving links in certain ways. With a dataset we have the underlying data, its structure which contains the structure &amp;amp; schema of the data.
All datasets have at most 6 components. The most important ones are:</description>

      <description>CLI Tutorial (last updated Nov 12, 2018, using qri version 0.6.0)
Welcome to the wonderful world of the Qri Command Line Interface. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll get you started with using qri&amp;rsquo;s command-line tools, giving a brief overview of what qri&amp;rsquo;s CLI can do.
The whole tutorial is divided into six sections. The topics are as follows:
 QLI Quickstart
1.1 qri help
1.2 qri version
1.3 qri setup

      <description>Content Addressing An address is a uniform, shorthand way of referring to things. Geographic addresses are an obvious example. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is the address of the White House. 268 Elizabeth St. is the address of my childhood home. These houses are different in size and function, but they are both locations with addresses that adhere to a (relatively) consistent system. Addresses make it easier to refer to places.</description>

      <description>Dataset A Dataset is a document for describing &amp;amp; storing structured data. Dataset documents are designed to satisfy the FAIR principle of being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, in relation to other dataset documents, and related-but-separate technologies such as data catalogs, HTTP API&amp;rsquo;s, and data package formats Datasets are designed to be stored and distributed on content-addressed (identify-by-hash) systems The dataset document definition is built from a research-first principle, valuing direct interoperability with existing standards over novel definitions or specifications.</description>

      <description>Going Distributed Makes Data Free &amp;amp; Dependable Qri doesn’t need a central server to work, instead it&amp;rsquo;s built in a distributed, peer-2-peer architecture that moves data by connecting computers directly. By connecting computers directly, we make storing data on Qri free, because datasets don&amp;rsquo;t have to be stored in the cloud. Your “payment” is the hard drive space to store the data you want to keep. This frees up datasets to get as big as they need to be, and stored wherever makes the most sense.</description>

      <description>Names in Qri It’s possible to refer to a dataset in a number of ways. It’s easiest to look at the full definition of a dataset reference, and then show what the “defaults” are to make sense of things. The full definition of a dataset reference is as follows:
dataset_reference = peer_name/dataset_name@/network/hash  an example of that looks like this:
b5/comics@/ipfs/QmejvEPop4D7YUadeGqYWmZxHhLc4JBUCzJJHWMzdcMe2y  In a sentence: b5 is the name of a peer, who has a dataset named comics, and it’s hash on the ipfs network at a point in time was QmejvEPop4D7YUadeGqYWmZxHhLc4JBUCzJJHWMzdcMe2y</description>

      <description>What is Qri (&amp;ldquo;query&amp;rdquo;)? Qri is a distributed dataset version control system built with peer-2-peer data exchange. Peers create datasets, which are stored in versions. Qri peers form a distributed network to exchange information about their datasets, which they transmit between each other over the distributed web.
Datasets are recorded structured data according to a specification that dictates the purpose of each component piece of a dataset. By design, qri can only store datasets.</description>

      <description>Starlark Syntax Qri (&amp;ldquo;query&amp;rdquo;) is about datasets. Transformations are repeatable scripts for generating a dataset. Starlark is a scripting language from Google that feels a lot like python. This package implements skylark as a transformation syntax. Starlark transformations are about as close as one can get to the full power of a programming language as a transformation syntax. Often you need this degree of control to generate a dataset.</description>

      <description>Deterministic Querying for the Distributed Web  Brendan O’Brien
Michael Hucka November 2017 Abstract The current infrastructure that underlies the distribution and processing of data over the Internet has enabled dramatic advances in a wide variety of human activities. Recent trends promoting open data promise even greater benefits as the number and variety of networked datasets grow. However, while current technologies and architectures obviously do work, they also show signs of systemic inefficiencies that impede effective large-scale discovery, distribution, preservation and reuse of datasets.</description>

      <description>The world of linked data is built on shaky foundations that prevent a true data commons from emerging. The problem isn’t with the data, but with the way data is linked. Specifically, the way links are addressed.
An address is a uniform, shorthand way of referring to things. Geographic addresses are an obvious example. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is the address of the White House. 268 Elizabeth St. is the address of my childhood home.</description>
